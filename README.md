# Character Frequency Analyzer

This is a simple Python script that takes a user-input string and counts how often each character appears. It uses a dictionary to store the character counts and prints the result.

This was one of my early Python practice projects focused on basic string handling and dictionaries.

## How to Run

```bash
python character_frequency.py
Enter a string: banana
{'b': 1, 'a': 3, 'n': 2}
